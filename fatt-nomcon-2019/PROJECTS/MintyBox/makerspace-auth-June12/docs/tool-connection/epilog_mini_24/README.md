## Mini 24 Connection

There are quite a few subcomponents here, but the gist of it is we interrupt the
front door interlock unless you've successfully badged in.

### Mounting plates

Cut these out of 6mm MDF or acrylic.  You'll need the following parts to attach
your box:

* [inner plate](plates/one_box_mount_inner.svg)
* [outer plate](plates/one_box_mount_outer.svg)

| Item               | Qty |
| ------------------ | --- |
| M4x14              | 8   |
| M4 nut             | 8   |
| M4 (fender) washer | 8   |
| #8-32 x 7/8" or 1" | 2   |

In a pinch you can switch #8 to be M4... but either you have to get the length
perfect or be at peace with the holes being re-threaded.

### Box

This is built around a 188x193mm box that you can get
[on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0725ZQFJW) or
[Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=waterproof+192*188*100mm).
There's plenty of room for activities in this.

You need to drill 4 holes in the back, and some holes in the sides.  See the
hole template for details (place it on the *back* of the box, and make sure it's
in the correct orientation).

Note the KK housing is installed after routing through a hole at the bottom of
the machine.  When crimping the M-F on green, the pins should be 180 deg out of
phase in order for the clips to line up like the photo.

### On BOFA

If you're installing this above a BOFA filter, you should move the feet over to
prevent slipping.  3 feet are easy, but the right front foot has a nut on the
inside.  Remove right panel to access.

Once feet are removed, there are other holes about 4" closer to the middle that have
the same thread.
